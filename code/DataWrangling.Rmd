## GBRMPA Bycatch Data Manipulation 

#### 1. Import Data

```{r}
bycatch_rawdata <- read.csv("data/bycatchdata.csv")
head(bycatch_rawdata)
```

#### 2. Tidy Data

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)   # For working with dates (dmy, year)
```

```{r}
bycatch_cleaned <- bycatch_rawdata %>% 
  # For all character/text columns, trim whitespace and apply title case.
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ str_to_title(str_trim(.)))) %>%
  # Replace "Dead" with "Deceased" in Fate column
  mutate(Fate = if_else(Fate == "Dead", "Deceased", Fate)) %>%
  mutate(Area = if_else(Area == "Cp F", "Gladstone", Area))
```

Check missing values:
```{r}
# Count total missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(bycatch_cleaned))

# Count total missing values in the whole dataset
sum(is.na(bycatch_cleaned))
```

2620 missing values in the longitude and latitude columns --> should only impact analysis in GIS.

#### 3. Data manipulation / analysis 

Summarise total bycatch by year:
```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)

# Prepare yearly count data
bycatchperyear <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Year = year(dmy(Date))) %>%
  count(Year)

summary_stats <- bycatchperyear %>%
  summarise(
    mean_bycatch = mean(n),
    sd_bycatch = sd(n),
    min_bycatch = min(n),
    max_bycatch = max(n),
    median_bycatch = median(n),
    n_years = n()
  )
```


#### 4. Plot the data
```{r}
# Line plot of bycatch per year
ggplot(bycatchperyear, aes(x = Year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Bycatch Events per Year",
       y = "Number of Bycatch Events",
       x = "Year")

```

```{r}
# Calculate mean and SD
mean_bycatch <- mean(bycatchperyear$n)
sd_bycatch <- sd(bycatchperyear$n)

# Plot with SD and mean
ggplot(bycatchperyear, aes(x = Year, y = n)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_bycatch, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_bycatch + sd_bycatch, linetype = "dotted", color = "red") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_bycatch - sd_bycatch, linetype = "dotted", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Bycatch Events per Year with Mean ± SD",
       y = "Number of Bycatch Events",
       x = "Year",
       caption = "Blue dashed = mean; red dotted = ±1 SD") +
  theme_classic()
```

Mean bycatch per month, summarised by year:
```{r}
# Step 1: Add Year and Month
bycatch_monthly <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  mutate(
    Date = dmy(Date),
    Year = year(Date),
    Month = month(Date, label = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  count(Year, Month)

# Step 2: Summarize by year (mean monthly bycatch ± SD)
yearly_summary <- bycatch_monthly %>%
  group_by(Year) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_bycatch = mean(n),
    sd_bycatch = sd(n),
    .groups = "drop"
  )

# Step 3: Plot mean ± SD
ggplot(yearly_summary, aes(x = Year, y = mean_bycatch)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_bycatch - sd_bycatch, ymax = mean_bycatch + sd_bycatch), width = 0.2) +
  labs(
    title = "Mean Monthly Bycatch per Year ± SD",
    y = "Mean Monthly Bycatch",
    x = "Year"
  ) +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = unique(yearly_summary$Year))
```


Use this plot for a basic summary at the start of results:

```{r}

# Step 1: Count total bycatch per year
bycatch_yearly <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  mutate(Year = year(dmy(Date))) %>%
  count(Year)

# Step 2: Calculate mean and SD
mean_bycatch <- mean(bycatch_yearly$n)
sd_bycatch <- sd(bycatch_yearly$n)

# Step 3: Create a ribbon data frame
ribbon_df <- bycatch_yearly %>%
  mutate(
    ymin = mean_bycatch - sd_bycatch,
    ymax = mean_bycatch + sd_bycatch
  )

# Step 4: Plot with proper shaded SD area
bycatch_yearly_plot <- ggplot(bycatch_yearly, aes(x = Year, y = n)) +
  geom_ribbon(data = ribbon_df, aes(x = Year, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax),
              inherit.aes = FALSE, fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean_bycatch, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +
  geom_line(color = "black", size = 1) +
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 2) +
  labs(
    y = "Number of Bycatch Events",
    x = "Year",
    caption = "Dashed line = mean; shaded area = ±1 SD"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"))

# Print the plot
print(bycatch_yearly_plot)
```







Export data as csv:
```{r}
library(readr)

# Export bycatch_cleaned to a CSV file
write_csv(bycatch_cleaned, "data/bycatch_cleaned.csv")
```
