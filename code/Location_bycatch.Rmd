## Analaysis of bycatch by location

```{r}
bycatch_rawdata <- read.csv("data/bycatchdata.csv")
head(bycatch_rawdata)
```

```{r}
bycatch_cleaned <- bycatch_rawdata %>% 
  # For all character/text columns, trim whitespace and apply title case.
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ str_to_title(str_trim(.)))) %>%
  # Replace "Dead" with "Deceased" in Fate column
  mutate(Fate = if_else(Fate == "Dead", "Deceased", Fate)) %>%
  mutate(Area = if_else(Area == "Cp F", "Gladstone", Area))
```

##### 1. Total bycatch per area 

```{r}
area_counts <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  count(Area, sort = TRUE)

# Basic bar plot to understand bycatch events by area 
ggplot(area_counts, aes(x = reorder(Area, n), y = n)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    x = "Area",
    y = "Bycatch Count"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

##### 2. Total bycatch per location 

```{r}
# Total bycatch per location
location_counts <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  count(Location, sort = TRUE)

# Fate breakdown by location (with all combinations filled in)
location_fate <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  group_by(Location, Fate) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  complete(Location, Fate, fill = list(Count = 0)) %>%
  group_by(Location) %>%
  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Create Area lookup from cleaned dataset
location_area_lookup <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  select(Location, Area) %>%
  distinct()

# Join Area info back into the fate table
location_fate_with_area <- location_fate %>%
  left_join(location_area_lookup, by = "Location")
```

```{r}
# Get top 15 locations by total bycatch
top_locations <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  count(Location, sort = TRUE) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 15) %>%
  pull(Location)

# Filter your fate data
location_fate_filtered <- location_fate %>%
  filter(Location %in% top_locations)


location_fate_top <- location_fate %>%
  filter(Location %in% top_locations)
```

```{r}
ggplot(location_fate_top, aes(y = reorder(Location, Proportion), x = Proportion, fill = Fate)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Released Alive" = "seagreen",
    "Deceased" = "firebrick",
    "Euthanised" = "goldenrod"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Bycatch Fate â€“ Top 15 Locations",
    x = "Proportion of Bycatch Events",
    y = "Location",
    fill = "Fate"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```


Location within area:
```{r}
# Step 1: Calculate total bycatch per location
top_locations_by_area <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  count(Area, Location, sort = TRUE) %>%
  group_by(Area) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 5) %>%  # Change 5 to any number you like
  ungroup()

# Step 2: Filter location fate data
location_fate_top_area <- location_fate_with_area %>%
  filter(Location %in% top_locations_by_area$Location)

library(stringr)

location_fate_top_area <- location_fate_top_area %>%
  mutate(Location = str_remove(Location, "^Cad \\d+ -\\s*"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(location_fate_top_area, aes(x = Location, y = Proportion, fill = Fate)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill", width = 0.8) +
  facet_wrap(~ Area, scales = "free_x") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Released Alive" = "seagreen",
    "Deceased" = "firebrick",
    "Euthanised" = "goldenrod"
  )) +
  labs(
    title = "Proportion of Bycatch Fate (Top Locations by Area)",
    x = "Location",
    y = "Proportion of Bycatch Events",
    fill = "Fate"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
```

Back to just area data:
```{r}
# Summarise by Area
area_fate_summary <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  group_by(Area, Fate) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  group_by(Area) %>%
  mutate(Proportion = Count / sum(Count)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(Area = fct_reorder(Area, Proportion, .fun = sum))  # sort by total

area_counts <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  count(Area, name = "BycatchCount") %>%
  arrange(desc(BycatchCount))  # optional: sort from high to low
```


```{r}
ggplot(area_counts, aes(y = fct_reorder(Area, BycatchCount), x = BycatchCount)) +
  geom_col(fill = "steelblue") +
  labs(
    title = "Total Bycatch Events by Area",
    x = "Bycatch Count",
    y = "Area"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```


**Plot fate proportions by Area:
```{r}
ggplot(area_fate_summary, aes(y = Area, x = Proportion, fill = Fate)) +
  geom_col(position = "fill", width = 0.8) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Released Alive" = "seagreen",
    "Deceased" = "firebrick",
    "Euthanised" = "goldenrod"
  )) +
  labs(
    x = "Proportion of Bycatch Events",
    y = "Area",
    fill = "Fate"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
```

```{r}
# Summarise raw counts by Area and Fate
area_fate_counts <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  group_by(Area, Fate) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  mutate(Area = fct_reorder(Area, Count, .fun = sum))  # Order by total bycatch

# Plot
ggplot(area_fate_counts, aes(y = Area, x = Count, fill = Fate)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack", width = 0.8) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Released Alive" = "seagreen",
    "Deceased" = "firebrick",
    "Euthanised" = "goldenrod"
  )) +
  labs(
    x = "Bycatch Count",
    y = "Area",
    fill = "Fate"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold")
  )
```
