## Species bycatch analysis

```{r}
bycatch_rawdata <- read.csv("data/bycatchdata.csv")
head(bycatch_rawdata)
```

```{r}
bycatch_cleaned <- bycatch_rawdata %>% 
  # For all character/text columns, trim whitespace and apply title case.
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~ str_to_title(str_trim(.)))) %>%
  # Replace "Dead" with "Deceased" in Fate column
  mutate(Fate = if_else(Fate == "Dead", "Deceased", Fate)) %>%
  mutate(Area = if_else(Area == "Cp F", "Gladstone", Area))
```

##### 1. Find most commonly caught species:
```{r}
species_counts <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  count(CommonName, sort = TRUE)

# View top 10 most common species
head(species_counts, 10)
```

##### 2. Species fate (Released Alive or Deceased)
```{r}
species_fate_summary <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  group_by(CommonName, Fate) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  filter(!is.na(CommonName))  # In case there are any blanks
```

##### 3. Plotting 
Bycatch counts and fate by species
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)

# Step 1: Count total bycatch per species
species_totals <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  count(CommonName, sort = TRUE)

# Step 2: Filter out rare species
species_to_keep <- species_totals %>%
  filter(n >= 5) %>%
  pull(CommonName)

# Step 3: Get counts by species and fate, then reorder and reverse levels
species_fate_counts <- bycatch_cleaned %>%
  filter(CommonName %in% species_to_keep) %>%
  group_by(CommonName, Fate) %>%
  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>%
  # Reorder by total and then reverse the factor levels
  mutate(CommonName = fct_reorder(CommonName, Count, .fun = sum)) %>%
  mutate(CommonName = fct_rev(CommonName))  # This flips the axis

```

Plot the data 
```{r}
ggplot(species_fate_counts, aes(y = CommonName, x = Count, fill = Fate)) +
  geom_col(position = "stack", width = 0.8) +  # slightly narrower bars
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(
    "Released Alive" = "seagreen",
    "Deceased" = "firebrick",
    "Euthanised" = "goldenrod"
  )) +
  labs(
    y = "Species (Common Name)",
    x = "Bycatch Count",
    fill = "Fate"
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, margin = margin(r = 5)),
    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold")# improved spacing
  )
```
